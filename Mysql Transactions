MySQL Transaction : 

A transaction is usually a result that occur when a user program is executing or execute.IT is a unit of program execution that access and 
update various tables.

Transaction Properties : ACID Properties

Atomicity: Atomicity indicate that either the operations of transactions are executed completly or not at all.
Consistancy: Database shouldremain in consistent state before execution of transaction or after execution of transaction.
Isolation: If you are in the middle of the transactions other process wont be able to see the data until the transaction is complete.
Durability: After the transaction complete successfully the changes it has made to the database persists dispits failure of system.

START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax:

These statements provide control over use of transactions:

START TRANSACTION or BEGIN start a new transaction.
COMMIT commits the current transaction, making its changes permanent.
ROLLBACK rolls back the current transaction, canceling its changes.
SET autocommit disables or enables the default autocommit mode for the current session.

By default, MySQL runs with autocommit mode enabled. This means that as soon as you execute a statement that updates (modifies) a table,
MySQL stores the update on disk to make it permanent. The change cannot be rolled back.
To disable autocommit mode implicitly for a single series of statements, use the START TRANSACTION statement:

example: 
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
UPDATE table2 SET summary=@A WHERE type=1;
COMMIT;

With START TRANSACTION, autocommit remains disabled until you end the transaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK. The autocommit mode then reverts
to its previous state.
